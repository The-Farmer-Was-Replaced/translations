## How to change the language of the game

1. **Download the Language Folder**:
   - Navigate to the repository and download the folder containing your desired language.

2. **Extract the Files**:
   - Extract the downloaded files.

3. **Backup the Original Files**:
   - Before replacing the existing files, create a backup of the original `EN` files. Copy the contents of the following directory to a safe location:
     ```
     ...\Steam\steamapps\common\The Farmer Was Replaced\TheFarmerWasReplaced_Data\StreamingAssets\Languages\EN
     ```

4. **Replace the Existing Files**:
   - Copy the extracted files into the following directory:
     ```
     ...\Steam\steamapps\common\The Farmer Was Replaced\TheFarmerWasReplaced_Data\StreamingAssets\Languages\EN
     ```
   - You will need to replace the existing files in the `EN` folder since the game is hardcoded to use this folder, and it does not officially support other languages.

5. **Launch the Game**:
   - Start the game, and it should now display the new language.
